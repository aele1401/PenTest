# X-CORP

## Description
X-CORP is a comprehensive penetration testing and incident response project focused on evaluating the security posture of X-CORP's systems. This was done through simulating a Red Team and Blue Team environment, conducting a penetration test with modular, repeatable, and effective security testing processes while leveraging security tools for offensive security. As for defensive security, the task was to test, implement, and monitor alerts generated from SIEM and security tools to respond to security incidents. Also, to conduct network forensics to analyze and report on malicious activity not detected by security tools.

The project involves various stages of pentesting, including reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and post-exploitation analysis. It also incorporates the incident response cycle, including preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. The primary goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats within X-CORP systems, assess their impact, implement new alerts and detections using data analysis, and provide recommendations for mitigating these risks.

## Overview
You are working as a Security Engineer for X-CORP, supporting the SOC infrastructure. The SOC Analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate. You will start by confirming that newly created Kibana alerts are working, after which you will monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that are not reflected in the alerting system. You are to report back all your findings to both the SOC Manager and the Engineering Manager with appropriate analysis.

## Key Features
* **Offensive Security**:
    - Reconnaissance: Gathering information on the target system, including network mapping and identifying potential attack vectors.
    - Vulnerability Assessment: Scanning the sytem for vulnerabilities using industry-standard tools.
    - Exploitation: Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to assess the extent of the security risk.
    - Post-Exploitation: Analyzing the impact of successful exploits, including privilege escalation and data exfiltration.
    - Reporting: Documenting findings, providing a risk assessment, and recommending security improvements.

* **Defensive Security**:
    - Preparation:
        * Establish a well-documented IR plan that has assigned roles and prepare tools, such as SIEM, EDR, scanner, alert testing, etc.
        * Set objectives and goals for the Red Team (phishing, lateral movement, etc.), and Blue Team (Define KPIs like MTTR.)
    - Identification:
        * Monitoring & Detection: Use monitoring tools like SIEM or IDS/IPS to detect unusual activity. Also, review logs, alerts, and network traffic for anomalies (e.g., spikes in outbound traffic, unauthorized access attempts).
        * Triage Alerts: Prioritize alerts based on severity and potential impact. Confirm whether it's a false positive or a legitimate incident.
    - Containment:
        * Immediate Actions: Disconnect affected systems from the network to prevent further spread. Apply firewall rules to block malicious IPs or domains.
        * Short-Term Containment: Isolate compromised accounts, endpoints, or servers while maintaining evidence integrity.
    - Eradication: 
        * Root Cause Analysis: Identify the root cause of the incident (e.g., exploited vulnerability, misconfigured system). Investigate using tools like memory forensics or malware analysis.
        * Remove Threats: Patch vulnerabilities, update software, and remove malware. Reconfigure access controls and security policies.
    - Recovery:
        * Restore Systems: Reinstall or restore affected systems using clean backups. Verify that systems are no longer compromised.
        * Monitor Post-Recovery: Watch for recurring signs of compromise. Increase monitoring on previously affected systems.
    - Lessons Learned:
        * Debrief & Document: For Red Team, provide a detailed report of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used. As for Blue Team, document findings, response actions, and lessons learned.
        * Improve Defenses: Update playbooks, tools, and configurations based on gaps identified during the exercise. Conduct follow-up training or simulations to reinforce learning.

* Communication:
    - Internal Reporting:
        * Keep key stakeholders informed of progress during incident.
        * Use clear channels of communication for efficient coordination.
    - External Communication (if applicable):
        * Plan communication with affected parties, regulators, or the public in real-world scenarios.
