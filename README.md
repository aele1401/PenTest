# XCORP Penetration Test

The purpose of this exercise was to simulate a Red Team and Blue Team environment. The objective of this exercise was to utilize tools and resources to act as a penetration tester and SOC analyst.

* Defensive Security: Implement the alerts and thresholds that have been determined to be effective.
* Offensive Security: Assess a vulnerable VM and verify that the Kibana rules work as expected.
* Network Forensics: Use Wireshark to analuze live malicious traffic.
* Reporting: Deliver final report.

## Overview

You are working as a Security Engineer for X-CORP, supporting the SOC infrastructure. The SOC Analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate.
You will start by confirming that newly created kibana alerts are working, after which you will monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system.
You are to report back all your findings to both the SOC manager and the Engineering Manager with appropriate analysis.

The goal of this exercise was to:
*	Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.
*	Find vulnerabilities and exploits to gain system access.
*	Utilize Wireshark to dissect network packets and analyze traffic.
*	Document findings and deliver final report that includes risks, mitigation strategies, and recommendations.

Tools used:
* Microsoft Azure
* Hyper-V
* Kali Linux
* ELK Stack
* John-Ripper
* Wireshark
* Filebeat, Metricbeat, Packetbeat
* Kibana & Elasticsearch Watcher
* SQL & Python
