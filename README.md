# X-CORP Penetration Test

The purpose of this test was to simulate a Red Team and Blue Team environment by conducting a penetration test with modular, repeatable, and effective security testing processes while leveraging security tools for offensive security (Red Team). As for defensive security (Blue Team), the task was to test, implement, and monitor alerts generated from SIEM and security tools to respond to security incidents. Also, to conduct host, network, and digital forensics to analyze and report on malicious activity not detected by security tools.

* Defensive Security: Test and implement the alerts and metrics that have been determined to be effective in Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK).
* Offensive Security: Assess a vulnerable virtual machine and verify that the Kibana rules and alerts are working.
* Network Forensics: Use Wireshark to analyze live malicious traffic.
* Reporting: Deliver a penetration test report that includes summary, vulnerabilities, exploits, risks, impact, and remediation.

## Overview

You are working as a Security Engineer for X-CORP, supporting the SOC infrastructure. The SOC Analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate.
You will start by confirming that newly created Kibana alerts are working, after which you will monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that are not reflected in the alerting system.
You are to report back all your findings to both the SOC manager and the Engineering Manager with appropriate analysis.

Objectives:
*	Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.
*	Find vulnerabilities and exploits to gain system access.
*	Utilize Wireshark to dissect network packets and analyze traffic.
*	Document findings and deliver final report that includes risks, mitigation strategies, and recommendations.

Tools used:
* Microsoft Azure
* Hyper-V
* Kali Linux
* ELK Stack
* John-Ripper
* Wireshark
* Filebeat, Metricbeat, Packetbeat
* Kibana & Elasticsearch Watcher
* SQL & Python
