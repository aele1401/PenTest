### Network Topology

The following machines were identified on the network:
- Kali Machine
  * OS: Kali Linux
  * Role: Attack machine
  * IP: 192.168.1.90
- Target 1
  * OS: Debian Linux
  * Role: Target machine, machine to penetrate that's also hosting wordpress.
  * IP: 192.168.1.110
- ELK
  * OS: Ubuntu Linux
  * Role: ELK stack machine for network monitoring. Hosts Kibana & Elasticsearch.
  * IP: 192.168.1.100

### Description of Targets

The target of this attack was: `Target 1` (192.168.1.110).

Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:

### Monitoring the Targets

Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:

#### Name of Alert 1
Excessive HTTP Errors Alert

Alert 1 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: WHEN count() GROUPED OVER top 5 'http.response.status_code' IS ABOVE 400 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
  - **Threshold**: 400
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Bruteforce & Enumeration
  - **Reliability**: Alert is highly reliable as any normal responses will be filtered out. Alert is triggered after 400 threshold is exceeded.

#### HTP Request Size Monitor Alert
Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: WHEN sum() of http.request.bytes OVER all documents IS ABOVE 3500 FOR THE LAST 1 minute
  - **Threshold**: 3500
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Cross Site Scripting (XSS), DDOS, URL Manipulation.
  - **Reliability**: In terms of reliability, alert is medium since it can generate false positives, such as large & legit HTTP traffic.

#### CPU Usage Monitor Alert
Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: WHEN max() OF system.process.cpu.total.pct OVER all documents IS ABOVE 0.5 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
  - **Threshold**: 0.5
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Malware & Viruses.
  - **Reliability**: Alert is higly reliable since it shows what programs are running and how much resources is being used. It allows for the detection of malicious programs and improving CPU usage.

### Suggestions for Going Further (Optional)

The logs and alerts generated during the assessment suggest that this network is susceptible to several active threats, identified by the alerts above. In addition to watching for occurrences of such threats, the network should be hardened against them. The Blue Team suggests that IT implement the fixes below to protect the network:
- Excessive HTTP Errors
  - **Patch**: WordPress service hardening
    * Update WordPress service
    * Implement proper security controls to servers & WordPress (i.e., block requests made to web server, disable REST API feature, etc.)
    * Make login information inaccessible to public.
  - **Why It Works**: WPSCANS rely on REST API to enumerate users. Disabling the REST API feature prevents WPSCANS. Securing login info from public access allows for a more secure environment since sensitive credentials are no longer accessible. Updates to WordPress service ensures security by:
    * Fixes & patches to discovered vulnerabilities.
    * Performance & application improvements.
- HTTP Request Size Monitor
  - **Patch**: Input validation & Filtering Traffic from DOS Attacks
  * Limitations on request sizes, strings, and URLs
  * Input validation in dialogs & forms, especially when required to fill in a field.
  - **Why It Works**: 
  * Implementing these limitations will reduce the size of traffic (404 errors), preventing a loss of availability.
  * Input validation prevents malicious code from being entered, also called SQL injection. This prevents the breach of confidentiality & integrity. 
- CPU Usage Monitor
  - **Patch**: System Hardening - Against Malware
  * Implement a Host Intrustion Detection System (HIDS), such as Splunk, SolarWinds, SNORT, etc.
  * Antivirus tools 
  - **Why It Works**: 
  * HIDS can monitor and detect malicious activity on the host system & network, giving real-time alerts to these activities. 
  * Antivirus tools can detect, remove, and prevent these malicious activities.
